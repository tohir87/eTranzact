# eTranzact

This is intended for developers current/future developers that will be integrating with eTranzact as Etranzact doesn't currently have a sample code written in PHP.

#Note
The soap Url included here is etranzact demo. 
To successfully communicate with the wsdl, your IP address needs to be whitelisted with eTranzact.

Pls don't forget to include the test.class.php file.

Scripts on how to carry out bulk transfer and querying a Bulk transfer transaction would be added soon.
